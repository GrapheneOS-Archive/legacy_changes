These are the old changelogs for stable releases of GrapheneOS when it was
branded based on the former sponsor. The release notes before the Nougat
2016.12.06.05.21.23 release should be taken with a grain of salt since we
weren't really publishing them yet so it wasn't being done very carefully.

GrapheneOS started in 2014 based on Android KitKat but we only started keeping
more user friendly changelogs late in the Marshmallow era.

The Nexus 9 maintenance branch is not included. It split off when the other
devices moved to nougat-mr2-release and continued after the other devices moved
to Oreo-based releases. It may be included here in the future but we wanted to
avoid confusion.

Since Pixels, there are separate release channels including the public Stable
and Beta channels. Each Stable release made it through the Beta channel and our
internal Testing channel. The Nexus 5X and 6P moved to the current update
system with release channels with the Oreo-based 2017.09.24.15.

Releases that never made it to the Stable channel are not listed here, since
their list of changes ended up in a future Stable release anyway unless the
changes never shipped.
