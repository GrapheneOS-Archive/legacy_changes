- Updater (Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P): add makeshift legacy update system support (This update client was designed to run on top of the update_engine A/B update system and file-based encryption. It can't offer the same user experience and robustness elsewhere. However, due to some recent changes it's possible to hack in support for the legacy recovery-based update system. It will handle edge cases like a normal reboot after an update is downloaded strangely but the basics can work.)
