- Chromium: update to 61.0.3163.81 from 60.0.3112.116
- Chromium: backport support for the Android Oreo WebView
- Chromium: bump MonochromePublic targetSdkVersion to 26 to match the internal Monochrome metadata (needed to provide the WebView on Oreo among other things)
- remove Google WebView since our hardened Chromium builds provide the WebView again
- remove Google WebView from the WebView provider whitelist
- PDF Viewer: adopt targetSandboxVersion 2 to use the much stronger instant app style sandbox for the app itself (rendering already happened in the stronger WebView sandbox)
- Updater (Pixel, Pixel XL): migrate to Build.getSerial() API for enforcing update zip serialno constraints in anticipation of it becoming mandatory
- grant Updater app on Pixel and Pixel XL Phone permissions for Build.getSerial()
- leave deprecated Build.SERIAL field set to UNKNOWN (only support fetching the serial number via the new Build.getSerial() requiring the READ_PHONE_STATE permission)
