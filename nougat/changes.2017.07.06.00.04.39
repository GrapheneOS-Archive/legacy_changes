- Chromium: build full Monochrome library for 64-bit and WebView-only library for 32-bit instead of vice versa, and set 64-bit as the preferred ABI to spawn all Chromium and WebView renderers as 64-bit as was the case before we used Monochrome (unlike stock Android)
- Chromium: depend on WebView frameworks libraries
